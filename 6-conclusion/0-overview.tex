This project was initially envisioned as means of exploring MapReduce as an alternative to RDBMSs when working with relational datasets without the realization of exactly how varied different implementations of MapReduce may be. As such the project focus shifted to evaluating specifically couchDB's MapReduce implementation in the context of working with relational data.

In the context of this analysis, some insight into techniques on how to best to profile potential CSC1015F students by using admissions data is discussed.
