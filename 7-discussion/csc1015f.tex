\subsection{Grade / Benchmarks Correlation}
A sample of the CSV file containing the joined Grades and Benchmarks datasets as retrieved from CouchDB is shown in Figure \ref{fig-2-way-csv-output}. Using Microsoft Excel's correlation function, correlation between the Grades and various combinations of the Benchmarks data shows that compared to Gr12 results, the NBT scores correlate significantly better with CSC1015F performance. The highest correlation between benchmarking and CSC1015F course results occurs when the NBT scores are averaged, with either the NBT QL or NBT Mth (or both) scores double weighted; such a correlation is 0.50, which is considered a moderate correlation.

A full list of the correlations tested are shown in Table \ref{tbl-2-way-join-correlation}. Because none of the students have grades for the ``G 12 Mth Lit'' and ``G12 Mth Adv'' columns who attended the CSC1015F course, these benchmarks are not taking into account.
