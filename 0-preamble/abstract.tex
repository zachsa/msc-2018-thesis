CouchDB is a NoSQL database that is optimized for use with large semistructured or unstructured datasets. Data mining utilizes ETL processes, in which multiple datasets are joined and explored, then processed via machine learning. This project examines the application of CouchDB in the process of data mining.

MapReduce is used to create indices of data that is both ordered and aggregated. This allows for joins to be effectively performed after the data is retrieved. A list-function (as provided by the CouchDB API) is used to iterate through these indices and perform the joins, along with calculations of variance and correlation.
