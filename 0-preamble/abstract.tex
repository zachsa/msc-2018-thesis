CouchDB is a NoSQL database that shines when working with large semi/unstructured datasets. Data mining comprises ETL processes in which multiple datasets are joined, and explored before processing via machine learning. This project discusses the application of CouchDB within the data-mining process.

MapReduce is used to create indices of ordered, aggregated data on which joins can be performed performantly on retrieval. A \textit{list}-function (as provided by the CouchDB API) is used to iterate through indices performing such joins along with variance and correlation calculations.
