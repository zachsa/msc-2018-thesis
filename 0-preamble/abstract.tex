CouchDB is a NoSQL database that shines when working with large semi/un-structured datasets such as are typically used in data mining. Data mining comprises ETL processes in which multiple datasets are joined, and explored via projection (attribute filtering) \& selection (row filtering) before processing via machine learning. This project discusses the application of CouchDB within the data-mining process in terms of as a data store, and as part of system geared towards performing joins and aggregations on datasets within the context of CouchDB's MapReduce implementation.
