I would like to give special thanks to my project supervisor Associate Professor Sonia Berman - an extremely patient supervisor who had the foresight to push me (at great effort) in the direction that resulted in a completed MSc. I would also like to thank her for the effort she put in in terms of data acquisition and guiding me in designing the research topic. I would like to thank Jane Hendry and Stephen Marquard for providing the data exports and scrubbing that such exports required.

I would like to thank my family - Craig Smith, Meryl Smith, Josh Smith and Stephanie Honchell for showing support and understanding of the time I have dedicated to this over project. On a similar note I would like to thank my colleagues at Avesta LLC for patience as I complete this work.

And lastly I would like to thank the many people who helped me with insights into the thesis topic and the technologies I used. Including: Stephanie Honchell, Patrick DeSomma, Guy Bedford, Jan Lehnardt, Robert Newson and many others who have responded to my persistant (and probably irritating) messages over Slack, email, StackOverflow, etc.
