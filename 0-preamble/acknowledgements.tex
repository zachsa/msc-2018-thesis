I would like to give special thanks to my project supervisor Associate Professor Sonia Berman - an extremely patient supervisor who had the foresight to push me (at great effort) in the direction that resulted in a completed MSc. I would also like to thank her for the effort she put in in terms of data acquisition and guiding me in designing the research topic. I would like to thank Jane Hendry and Stephen Marquard for providing the data exports.

I would like to thank my family: Craig Smith, Meryl Smith, Josh Smith and Stephanie Honchell for showing support and understanding of the time I have dedicated to this over project. On a similar note I would like to thank my colleagues at Avesta (particularly Patrick DeSomma and Matthew Fluharty) for patience and understanding as I completed this work.

And lastly I would like to especialy thank Stephanie Honchell and Patrick DeSomma for helping me with insights, editing and reading. And also Guy Bedford, Jan Lehnardt, Robert Newsom and many others who helped me in very many ways.
