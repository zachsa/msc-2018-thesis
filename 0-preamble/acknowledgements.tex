I would like to give special thanks to my project supervisor Associate Professor Sonia Berman - an extremely patient supervisor who had the foresight to push me (at great effort) in the direction that resulted in a completed MSc. I would also like to thank her for the effort she put in in terms of data acquisition and guiding me in designing the research topic.

I would like to thank Jane Hendry and Stephen Marquard for providing the data exports and scrubbing that such exports required.

I would like to thank my parents and family for providing much needed motivation and great expections that needed to be met!

And lastly I would like to thank the many people who helped me with insights into the thesis topic and the technologies I used. Including: Stephanie Honchell, Patrick DeSomma, Guy Bedford, and many of the CouchDB community who took the time to reply to my messages over Slack and email.
