\subsection{CouchDB Server API}
CouchDB allows a user to specify several different types of functions that are executed on the server-side Erlang application. These functions need to be specified on a 'Design' document, which is simply a normal JSON document with an attribute "\_id" having a value of "\_design/documentName". A full list of the server API can be seen in the sample design document in \ref{appendix:designDoc}. There are 6 types of functions that a user can specify and are executed by the CouchDB application on the server: \textit{views}, \textit{shows}, \textit{lists}, \textit{updates}, \textit{filters}, and \textit{validation} checks. Via this API much of the functionality that you typically find in an RDBMS can be implemented in couchDB (albeit in a roundabout way). For example a SQL trigger could be implemented via a CouchDB \textit{update}, a SQL query could be implemented as a \textit{list} function and a \textit{view} index, etc. While the full range of data-interactions available on an RDBMS are available via CouchDB, however, to work with such a different DBMS requires a vastly different mindset and tool-set (using CouchDB requires a strong coding ability and an understanding of underlying programming concepts such as algorithms and data structures).

\subsection{Views}
Views comprise two components - a \textit{Map}-function component and a \textit{Reduce}-function component, the contracts of which are shown in \ref{appendix:designDoc}.

\subsubsection*{The \textit{\_stats} function}
Considering the performance cost of custom reduce functions in CouchDB, which is difficult to quantify and is worthy of an analysis in and of itself, only the built-in reduce function \textit{\_stats} is used in this project. This function requires that Map function output be a list of numbers

\subsection{List functions}
List functions fall under the category of \textit{CouchApps} and, as mentioned previously, are likely to be excluded from future releases. These functions iterate a view output to an HTTP(S) client, allowing a final phase of transformation - i.e. a data format switch from JSON documents to CSV format. Since \textit{list functions} form part of the HTTP API, these functions effectively allow for "insta-APIs" available to the world. \textit{List} functions take the name of a \textit{MapReduce} view as an argument and iterate through the results, passing those results to a user over HTTP(S). As with all of CouchDB interactions, list functions are invoked via HTTP and allow for an API of retrieving data from CouchDB views. As mentioned in \ref{appendix:slack}, list functions are deprecated and should be replaced by code external to the CouchDB application. \textit{nETL} could be easily configured to replace list functions with a small amount of coding.
