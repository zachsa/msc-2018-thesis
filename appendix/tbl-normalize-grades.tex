            \item[\textsuperscript{1}]30\% was applied on the estimate that these students wouldn't necessarily have completed the coursework, and that as such this is a `bad' fail
            \item[\textsuperscript{2}]40\% was applied on the estimate that this symbol would apply to students who participated in the course but still failed
            \item[\textsuperscript{3}]49\% was applied on the estimate that this is a `good' fail, in that the UF classification applies to borderline fails
            \item[\textsuperscript{4}]45\% was applied on the estimate that UP is the 'worst' pass, in that from a strictly grade perspective, these students technically failed
