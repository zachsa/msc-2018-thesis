            \item[\textsuperscript{1}]30\% was applied on the estimate that failing in this case was slightly 'worse' than a regular fail.
            \item[\textsuperscript{2}]20\% was applied on the estimate that these students wouldn't necessarily have completed the coursework.
            \item[\textsuperscript{3}]40\% was applied on the estimate that this symbol would apply to students who participated in the course.
            \item[\textsuperscript{4}]50\% was applied on the estimate that these students passed without distinction or by concession.
