\section{Benchmark Variance}
A \nth{3} analysis is done on the Benchmark data to assess the variances of each of the benchmarks evaluated. To achieve this, a single nETL task is run to load a database with Benchmarks data for all students who attended CSC1015F in either 2014, 2015, or 2016 (or attended the course multiple times). The JSON used for configuring nETL to load data from the \texttt{Benchmarks (2014 - 2016).csv} file into CouchDB is included in the appendix at \ref{netl-task-6-config}.

To achieve this, two nETL tasks were run to extract the CSV data (the ``Grades.CSV'' and ``Benchmarks.CSV'' files) and load rows from these CSV files into CouchDB as documents of type ``grade'' and ``benchmark'' respectively. The JSON configuration file in which both these tasks are defined is included in the appendix at \ref{netl-tasks-1-2-config}. Following loading the data from the CSVs into CouchDB, a Map function is used to produce an index of the CouchDB documents sorted by Student ID, with the guarantee that for every unique student id documents are ordered by type; demographic documents are sorted before Grade documents for for any given student. Knowing the sorted order of documents via the view-index allows for performing the join on data-retrieval. For this analysis, retrieval (and joining) is performed via a CouchDB List function (discussed below), with the output in CSV format.
