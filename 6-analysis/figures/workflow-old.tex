    \caption[Analysis Workflow]{\textbf{Figure \ref{analysis-workflow}: Workflow to perform an analysis.}1) User creates a configuration file (JSON) that is loaded into the running \textit{\_nETL} service. This configuration includes instructions on which CSVs to load, which modules should be loaded to process the CSVs, and configurations for the modules. 2) Modules are loaded from a library of available modules into the \textit{\_nETL} service. 3) CSVs are loaded into the service, and transformations are applied to the CSV data as specified by the configuration in (1). 4) Data from the CSVs is loaded into CouchDB; this is also achieved via a module specified in (1). 5) A user creates a CouchDB design document, specifying the MapReduce functions, and a List function. 6) The user asks CouchDB to produce the view index as specified by the design document in (5). 7) The user retrieves the data from the view index using the list function specified in (5). 8) The user then loads the resultant CSV into Excel to produce useful metrics.}
