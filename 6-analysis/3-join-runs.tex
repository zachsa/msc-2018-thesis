\subsubsection{Run 3: CS1015F}
Building on the results from \textit{Run 1}, a join on events data was added. To achieve this, n\textit{nETL} was reconfigured to filter grades for only 2016 (since event data is only available for 2016), and an additional \textit{nETL} task was configured to load event data. Filtering on the event data was performed on the (anonymized) uct\_id field to include only events from students who took the CSC1015F course in 2016. This list was derived from the Grade data using Excel.
