\subsubsection{Run 3: CS1015F}
Building on the results from \textit{Run 1}, a join on events data was added. To achieve this, n\textit{nETL} was reconfigured to filter grades for only 2016 (since event data is only available for 2016), and an additional \textit{nETL} task was configured to load event data. Filtering on the event data was performed on the (anonymized) uct\_id field to include only events from students who took the CSC1015F course in 2016, as was demographic data. Since there is no way to associate the event data to course data specifically, this analysis shows students' general usage of the Sakai platform vs grade achieved for CSC1015F specifically.

\subsubsection{Run 4: Multiple Courses}

\subsubsection{Correlation analysis}
As shown in \ref{run3-chart1}, there is a correlation between a students achieved grade and the amount of time they spend on Sakai, although the correlation isn't particularly strong. \ref{run3-chart2} shows that relative change in class ranking is not related to Sakai usage for the CSC1015F course.

TODO: Run 4 will then test this result on multiple courses...

    \caption[Change in class ranking vs Sakai usage]{\textbf{Figure \ref{run3-chart2}: Change in class ranking vs Sakai usage.} This chart shows the number of times a student logs into the Sakai platform compared to the change in their class ranking from benchmark tests to course result. To achieve this dataset, a student's ranking (R) is calculated for the final CSC1015F grade, and separately for each benchmarking test (shown in the key). The change in ranking is worked out as $CSC1015F R - Benchmark R $, with a positive R indicating that the student improved relative to their peers. This graph doesn't show a strong correlation between R and Sakai Usage}
