\subsection{Result 3}

CS1015F

Building on the results from \textit{Run 1}, a join on events data was added. To achieve this, n\textit{nETL} was reconfigured to filter grades for only 2016 (since event data is only available for 2016), and an additional \textit{nETL} task was configured to load event data. Filtering on the event data was performed on the (anonymized) uct\_id field to include only events from students who took the CSC1015F course in 2016, as was demographic data. Since there is no way to associate the event data to course data specifically, this analysis shows students' general usage of the Sakai platform vs grade achieved for CSC1015F specifically.
