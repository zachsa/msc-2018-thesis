\section{MapReduce}
In response to dealing with huge amounts of data daily, authors at Google (Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat) outlined the MapReduce framework as a means of abstracting the complications associated with distributed computing such as data distribution, fault tolerance, load balancing, and how to parallelize processing \cite{Dean:2008}. MapReduce provides programmers with a conceptually-simple interface for specifying dispersed data computations succinctly and hides the implementation details.

The framework relies on an astoundingly simple programming model described by \cite{Dean:2008} as a computation that takes a set of input key-value pairs and produces a set of output key-value pairs using the following 3 steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textit{mapping} stage in which distributed key-value pairs are produced from input data as described by a user-defined map function
    \item A \textit{grouping} stage where distributed key-value output from the mapping stage is collected to common keys - i.e. \textit{key:[value, value, value]} datasets
    \item And a \textit{reducing} stage where values per grouped key are processed as described by a user-defined reduce function
\end{itemize}

Due to the distributed and isolated nature of the map and reduce tasks, MapReduce as an idea is fault tolerant (specifically, fault tolerance is implemented via reexecution), which has in turn resulted in the ``New Software Stack'' \cite{mining2011}: large-scale computing clusters built on commodity (cheap) hardware and software that computes in parallel. Such an approach to building and maintaining systems represents the potential to process ever-greater amounts of data at ever cheaper rates. This has spurred information explosion across all manner of software applications.

Starting with the development of the Hadoop framework as an open-source alternative to Google's proprietary file system and MapReduce framework, MapReduce implementations have become mainstream. Companies that make use of this programming model including Yahoo, Facebook, Amazon, and many more \cite{chandar2010}. For example, the Apache Foundation maintains a list of companies that use the Hadoop framework \cite{hadoopPower:2017}.

Use-cases for systems utilizing MapReduce overlap significantly with the business domain that has long been cornered by RDBMSs. As such, a great deal of research has focused on leveraging MapReduce as a means of implementing operations that are traditionally associated with RDBMSs - specifically in instances of \textit{relational-algebra} \cite{mining2011,chandar2010}. The full spectrum of relational operations: \textit{selection}, \textit{projection}, \textit{union}, \textit{intersection}, \textit{difference}, \textit{joins} (exempting non-equi joins, which cannot be implemented via MapReduce), \textit{grouping} and \textit{aggregation} are translatable to MapReduce \cite{mining2011}. MapReduce allows for implementing \textit{joins}, including both \textit{Two-way} and \textit{Multi-way}, by using a variety of algorithms. A masterâ€™s thesis from the University of Edinburgh demonstrates joining in Hadoop via \textit{Map-Side joins}, \textit{Reduce-Side One-Shot joins},\textit{Reduce-Side Cascade joins} and more \cite{chandar2010}.
