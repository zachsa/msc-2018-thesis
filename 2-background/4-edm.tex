\section{Educational Data Mining}
The focus of this project is the manipulation of data using CouchDB and associated technologies, whilst specifically using data from the business domain of \textit{Educational Data Mining} (EDM). This field is well developed and many studies have sought to model student performance based on markers such as attendance; assignment and test grades; high school marks; demographic data; etc. Different means of model generation have been discussed by the EDM community, such as predictive analysis via decision tree generation \cite{Qasem20016,Balestra2017,casper2017,Dimitris,zebun2005,Mierle:2005}, with varying results. Other models have been applied within the field of EDM, as discussed in a review of EDM up to 2009 \cite{bakerEdMiningSummary}.
