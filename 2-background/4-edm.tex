\section{Educational Data Mining}
The focus of this project is data manipulation using CouchDB and associated technologies using data from the business domain of \textit{Educational Data Mining} (EDM). This field is well developed and much work has been done with the intent of modeling student performance as dependent on certain markers such as attendance, assignment and test grades, high school marks, demographic data, etc. Different means of model generation have been discussed by the EDM community such as predictive analysis via decision tree generation \cite{Qasem20016,Balestra2017,casper2017,Dimitris,zebun2005,Mierle:2005} with varying results. Many other models have been applied within the field of EDM as discussed in a review of EDM up to 2009 \cite{bakerEdMiningSummary}.
