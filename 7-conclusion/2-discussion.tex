\section{Discussion}

\subsection*{Correlation analysis}
The results for \textit{Run 1} and \textit{Run 2} have been summarized in the graphs in Figure \ref{run1-chart1}; several courses were picked at random to show correlation between course grades and student benchmarks. The results show that in general, higher benchmarking scores are indicative of higher course results overall. Some of the benchmarks show stronger correlation to grade results than other, as seen by steeper trendline gradient.

Datasets focus on a single benchmark, so a trendline shows the correlation between a single benchmark and final grades.}

As shown in \ref{run3-chart1}, there is a correlation between a students achieved grade and the amount of time they spend on Sakai, although the correlation isn't particularly strong. \ref{run3-chart2} shows that relative change in class ranking is not related to Sakai usage for the CSC1015F course.

    \caption[CSC1015 grade vs general Sakai usage]{\textbf{Figure \ref{run3-chart1}: Correlation between students' general Sakai usage and CSC1015F results.} The count of a student's presence events on the Sakai platform seems to show a slight correlation with grade achieved in the CSC1015F course.}

    \caption[Change in class ranking vs Sakai usage]{\textbf{Figure \ref{run3-chart2}: Change in class ranking vs Sakai usage.} This chart shows the number of times a student logs into the Sakai platform compared to the change in their class ranking from benchmark tests to course result. To achieve this dataset, a student's ranking (R) is calculated for the final CSC1015F grade, and separately for each benchmarking test (shown in the key). The change in ranking is worked out as $CSC1015F R - Benchmark R $, with a positive R indicating that the student improved relative to their peers. This graph doesn't show a strong correlation between R and Sakai Usage}
