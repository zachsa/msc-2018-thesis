This project was initially envisioned as means of exploring MapReduce as an alternative to RDBMSs when working with relational datasets without the realization of exactly how varied different implementations of MapReduce may be. As such the project focus shifted to evaluating specifically couchDB's MapReduce implementation in the context of working with relational data.
