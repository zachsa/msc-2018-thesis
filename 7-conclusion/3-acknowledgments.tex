\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to give special thanks to my project supervisor Associate Professor Sonia Berman - an extremely patient supervisor who had the foresight to push me (at great effort) in the direction that resulted in a completed MSc. I would also like to thank her for the effort she put in in terms of data acquisition and guiding me in designing the research topic. I would also like to thank Jane Hendry and Stephen Marquard for providing the data exports and scrubbing that such exports required. And lastly I would like to thank the many people who helped me with insights into the thesis topic and the technologies I used. Including: Stephanie Honchell, Patrick DeSomma, Guy Bedford, and many of the CouchDB community who took the time to reply to my messages over Slack.
