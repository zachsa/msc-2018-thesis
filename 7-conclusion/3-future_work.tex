\section{Future work}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item test on much larger cluster sizes
    \item test with different n,q values
    \item UI research for nETL - the JSON config is pretty cool. maybe non-techinical people could use it
    \item test same cluster sizes on different linux VMs (different amount of power per pc)
\end{enumerate}
