Files are read in 64KB chunks from beginning to end within the context of an iterator created by a JavaScript \textit{generator} function \cite{mozillaGenerators}. Chunks are held in memory, split into lines (identified by \textit{LF}, \textit{CR} or \textit{CRLF} line endings) and yielded a single line at a time to a controlling function. This function iteratively collects \mintinline{text}{n} lines at a time into a list (\mintinline{n} is a user configurable property \textit{batchSize}) and yields line-lists (\textit{batches}) iteratively to \mintinline{text}{taskManager}.

Lines in batches are then transformed in parallel, with transformations (specified in configuration) applied to each line in the batch in the order specified in the configuration. Once all transformation have been applied to all lines in the batch, \textit{taskManager} passes the transformed batch to the loading function (also specified via configuration). This function's contract is such that \textit{taskManager} is notified of when the batch has been loaded successfully to the destination, at which a further batch of lines is generated and processed. etc.
