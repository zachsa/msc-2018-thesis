Performance metrics of the different components of the system are recorded and are shown in Table \ref{tbl-metadata} showing running time of nETL tasks, a summary of the data processed by nETL, CouchDB indexing times, and database/index storage footprints. The signature of nETL's asynchronous task management is clear; tasks take longer to run when run concurrently with other tasks. But the processing is asynchronous, since log lines from separate tasks are interleaved.
