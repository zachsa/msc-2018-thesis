With special thanks to data owners Jane Hendry (UCT's CIO) and Stephen Marquard (the Learning Technologies Coordinator from the Center for Innovation in Learning and Teaching at UCT), student data has been made available encompassing UCT admissions data, course grades, and Sakai interactions. The three separate datasets are classified in terms of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{grades}: UCT course results
    \item \textit{admissions}: Student matric results and national benchmark test (NBT) results
    \item \textit{events}: Student interactions with the Sakai platform, measured as browser interactions
\end{itemize}

All three datasets are in CSV format and have the a student number field in common. This field is anonymized consistently across all three datasets to preserve row associations.

\section{Grades}
Three years of data is available: 2014, 2015 and 2016 received as separate CSV files. A compilation of these three files is used in which the structure (the files are delimited differently) is normalized. The fields of the compiled file is described in Table \ref{tbl-data-grades}, and a sample of this file is shown in Figure \ref{fig-sample-grades}. Essentially this data comprises a list of grades achieved for specific courses in specific years along with student numbers. The separate files could just as easily be used as received, but for the purposes of this investigation it is easier to work with a single file than multiple files.

\section{Admissions}
Three years of data is available: 2014, 2015, 2016 received as separate CSV files. As received the files are disorganized; corresponding fields are spelled/capitalized differently across the files, the files have completely different sets of fields, fields ordering is inconsistent, and the files are delimited differently. It is possible to work with these files directly, but doing so would only complicate the analysis procedure and not add any value to the investigation. As such, a single CSV is compiled with the following addressed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fields are adjusted to be spelled the same with normalized whitespace (where field names contain whitespace)
    \item Duplicated fields are removed (UCT performance is appended to each student's admissions data for years subsequent to enrollment)
    \item Contentious data (race, gender, etc.) that this project is not ethically cleared to work with is scrubbed away
\end{itemize}

The single, processed admissions CSV file contains an anonymized list of students that enrolled at UCT along with these student's matric results and NBT scores. The CSV file is described in Table \ref{tbl-data-admissions} and a sample of the file is shown in Figure \ref{fig-sample-admissions}.

\section{Events}
Sakai usage data is available for the 2016 year, recieved as a single CSV file that is 5.2GB in size. Due to it's large size, the file cannot be opened in Microsoft Excel and so no scrubbing/amendment is performed on it. Fields in this file are described in Table \ref{tbl-data-events}. The file as received doesn't contain header information, which had to be obtained separately; these headers are included in the CSV sample as shown in Figure \ref{fig-sample-events} for ease of reference. In this sample, values for the field \textit{ref} are replaced with "txt" - also for display purposes. As a side note, when working with files that cannot be opened due to their large size, it is possible to print out a subset of the file using a BASH terminal via the command \mintinline{text}{head -n <N> <file.ext>} where \mintinline{text}{N} is the number of lines to print.
