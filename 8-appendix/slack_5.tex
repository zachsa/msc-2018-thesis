when I look at data/shards/... I see that my database is split amongst 8 shards on my single node setup. How does Couch distribute documents to each shard (i'm using the default _id generator). When in clustered mode, can I assume that data gets distributed amongst shards evently?

it's based on a hash of the document

[11:49]
which should be random enough to ensure equal distribution

zach [11:49 AM]
Thank you

in clustered mode, in a 3 node cluster, every node gets a copy of your document

[11:49]
so all 8 shards are stored on all 3 nodes (total 24 shards)

zach [11:49 AM]
that's if n=3 though?

[11:49]
if I configure n=1, q=8

    [11:50]
this is to see if increasing number of nodes in a cluster reduces index time... should it?

[11:51]
if n > 1, would that result in an index being calculated more than once/

[11:51]
?
