Hi - is there anyway to simulate a SQL 'Window' function in CouchDB? i.e. could I do something like `rank() over(partition by someClassification order by someNumber desc)`. Since I can't guarantee that in my reduce function I will have all the values for a particular key, I'm assuming 'no'?

or outside of CouchDB with the reduce result. Would avoid list funs
