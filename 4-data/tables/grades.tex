\item[\textsuperscript{3}]Only courses taken by students registered as undergraduates (UGRD) were considered in this study.
\item[\textsuperscript{4}]A wide variety of course suffixes are present in the database, including: D,F,H,L,M,N,P,Q,R,S,W,X,Z.
\item[\textsuperscript{5}]The percent field included both numbers and abbreviations that need to be normalized so that this field can be treated as always holding a numerical value. A table showing how the different suffixes and abbreviations of the percent field is shown in \ref{tbl-sakai-grades-percent}
\item[\textsuperscript{6}]Only courses at undergraduate level (UGRD) were considered for this project.





\textit{Course grade} data was received for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The field \textit{course\_id} was found to not correspond with the \textit{event} data field \textit{site\_key}, meaning that the \textit{event} and \textit{grade} data is only relatable by year and student ID, and not per individual course.
